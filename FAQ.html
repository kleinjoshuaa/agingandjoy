<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Who would benefit from Aging and Joy Services LCC?</h3> 

If you've feeling concerned about your ability to live alone, feeling concerned about your ability to care for a loved one, struggling to take care of yourself, experiencing changes in activities of daily living, experienced a fall, have an increased fear of falling, experiencing changes in memory, increased incontinence (accidents of bladder or bowel), or struggling with a new diagnosis… you might benefit from our services! Please reach out for a consultation. 




<h3>What is Occupational Therapy?</h3>

Occupational therapy gives you the knowledge, skills, and strength to maintain and increase independence for those daily ‘occupations’ or activities of daily living that you want and need to do.  
Occupational Therapy starts with an evaluation of the client, activities of daily living (ADLs), medical status, cognition, home environment, and fall risk assessment. 
Together we will create client goals in collaboration with caregivers and physician. Goals may be to improve or maintain independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) through strength training, balance training, coordination training, compensatory strategies, task adaptation, environmental modification, caregiver training, and improved health literacy. Occupational therapy must be medically necessary rehabilitation or maintenance services.




<h3>What is functional wellness? </h3>

Some clients might not need skilled Occupational therapy, but they might lack the confidence to be independent in tasks. Having an occupational therapist as part of the care team gives you and your family peace of mind and improves your independence and safety. 
Functional wellness is a partnership between clinician, client, and caregivers to perform everyday tasks with maximum independence and safety.  Everyday tasks we help with bathing or showering, meal preparation, laundry, light housekeeping, grocery shopping, pharmacy runs, and doctor appointments. It is not having a cleaning service, functional wellness is having someone work with the client to complete household tasks together with maximum independence and safety.  Functional wellness is more than transportation to doctor appointments, it is someone to support the client by asking the right questions and helping to implement the recommended interventions. Functional wellness also helps clients stay healthy and safe at home with patient advocacy, caregiver training, dementia care, care coordination, and exercise routines.  Additionally, many of our clients and their families are concerned that after therapy has ended, they will not be able to keep up with their exercise program, these clients will continue to benefit from functional wellness exercise routines. 




<h3>What are home modifications?</h3>
Home modifications are some of the ways occupational therapists can help to make things easier and safer around the home. Home modifications are important for fall prevention. They can be simple things like task lighting, making cupboards more accessible, adding garb bars, or adjusting the layout to allow better mobility. Based on the occupational therapy evaluations, recommendations will then be given as to what home modifications would benefit your goals, lifestyle, and medical limitations.




<h3>How do I prevent falls at home? </h3>

Fall prevention starts with identify fall risk factors, reducing hazards within the home, and improving balance. If you are concerned with falls please contact me for Occupational Therapy services.
