<h3>Functional Wellness</h3>

<P>Some clients might not need <i>skilled occupational therapy</I>, but they might lack the confidence to be independent in tasks. Having an occupational therapist as part of the care team gives you and your family peace of mind and improves your independence and safety. 
Functional wellness is a partnership between clinician, client, and caregivers to perform everyday tasks with maximum independence and safety.  Everyday tasks we help with bathing or showering, meal preparation, laundry, light housekeeping, grocery shopping, pharmacy runs, and doctor appointments. It is not having a cleaning service, functional wellness is having someone work with the client to complete household tasks together with maximum independence and safety.  Functional wellness is more than transportation to doctor appointments, it is someone to support the client by asking the right questions and helping to implement the recommended interventions. Functional wellness also helps clients stay healthy and safe at home with patient advocacy, caregiver training, dementia care, care coordination, and exercise routines. </p>  
<P>Additionally, many of our clients and their families are concerned that after therapy has ended, they will not be able to keep up with their exercise program, these clients will continue to benefit from functional wellness exercise routines. </P
