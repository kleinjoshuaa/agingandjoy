<h2>Hello!</h2>

<p>I'm Danielle Klein.  Most people call me Dolly. I'm an Occupational Therapist and the owner of Aging and Joy Services LLC.</p>

<p>I do occupational therapy for retired folks. </p>

<p>As an Occupational Therapist I typically work to improve independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) and prevent falls through upper body strengthening, improved balance, improved coordination, compensatory strategies, task adaptation, environmental modification, caregiver training, and improved health literacy. I absolutely love treating clients in their home and community, because that is where people find their joy!  </p>

<p>I started Aging and Joy Services LLC to help my clients with aging in place, but also to be able to spend more time with my clients and offer them more services. </p>

<p><strong>  When you hire me, we will work to achieve your goals for independence, safety, and joy in life. </strong> </p>

<p> I graduated with my Masters of Occupational Therapy (MOT) in 2013. I am a Certified Dementia Practitioner.  I am certified in LSVT BIG (an amplitude-based exercise program for individuals with Parkinson's). I am trained in the Otago exercise program (exercise-based fall risk management program). I worked in skilled nursing facilities (nursing homes/rehabilitation centers) for 5 years. I worked in skilled home health care for 3 years. </p>
